# Challenge 2

You have an Angular application built entirely around the AppComponent. This component has an input box for name, and it has a name attribute. The component also displays a hello greeting. Your challenge is to bind the value of the input box to the name attribute, which in turn will change the greeting as you update the name in the input box.

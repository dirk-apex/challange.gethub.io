# Challenge 3

In this challenge, you have the name input box bound to the name variable in AppComponent. We also have a list of names at the bottom of the view. We have added a button which is supposed to add the name from the input box into the list of names. Your task is to bind the "Add Name" button to the addPerson() method in the PersonService. Once you make that binding, the name will be added to the list of names.
